# JSPOWELL
## JavaScript Powellâ€™s Method

This library takes Powell's conjugate direction method from
[optimization-js][1] and provides a wrapper that makes it compatible
to the interface of Cory McCartan's ES6 genetic algorithm library
[jsga][2] (or the extended version [jsga-feklee][3]).

## Installation

Yarn: `yarn add jspowell`

Or you can download `jspowell.js` from the [GitHub repo][4].
